# Simple-Cryptography-Tool

This is a simple Python-based cryptography tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter of a message by a certain number of places down the alphabet. The Vigenère Cipher is a more complex encryption technique that uses a keyword to encrypt a message.

## Project Features:

- Encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher.
- Ability to enter a message and a key for encryption/decryption.
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Displays the encrypted/decrypted message on the console.
- Allows the user to choose between the Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher.

## Instructions:

1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
2) Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3) Run the command python crypt.py to start the program.
4) Follow the instructions on the console to encrypt or decrypt a message.
